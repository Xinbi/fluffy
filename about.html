            <summary><h4>Who is Lyria, and why do we worship Her?</h4></summary>
            <p>Lyria is the Goddess of Joy and Fluff, First Spinner of the Velvet Dawn, and Keeper of the Eternal Hop. She arrived in a vision of moonlight and soft paws, commissioning us to restore joy and gentle chaos to a world gone overly serious.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Is the Church of Her Holy Fluff a “real” religion?</h4></summary>
            <p>As real as a purring cat on your lap or glitter you’ll <em>never</em> get out of the carpet. Legitimacy is measured in kindness rendered and community built — we score highly on both.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>How do Fluffbearers believe the world was created?</h4></summary>
            <p>When Lyria shook out Her holy tutu, particles of joy condensed into stars, planets, and the occasional marshmallow. Earth was spun from the fur of the Celestial Rabbit and stitched with silver moonlight. Scientifically unprovable... gloriously so.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>What are your core beliefs?</h4></summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Joy is sacred.</li>
              <li>Fluffiness is a divine property.</li>
              <li>Anyone saying “stop being silly” likely needs more silliness.</li>
              <li>All souls are redeemable through the Holy Hop.</li>
              <li>Yarn is inherently good.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Do you have sacred rituals?</h4></summary>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Blessing of the Bean</strong> — sharing coffee, cocoa, or other bean‑based comfort to awaken the spirit.</li>
              <li><strong>Monday Gathering</strong> — storytelling, bunny‑eared headwear, and the occasional awkward interpretive dance.</li>
              <li><strong>The Glittering</strong> — marking the faithful with sacred shimmer (biodegradable when possible).</li>
              <li><strong>The Fluffing</strong> — details for initiated Fluffbearers only, reverent and always consensual.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Are there commandments?</h4></summary>
            <ol>
              <li>Thou shalt spread joy and fluff wherever thou hop.</li>
              <li>Thou shalt not harsh another’s sparkle.</li>
              <li>Always return borrowed glitter (or replace it with more).</li>
            </ol>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Who opposes Lyria?</h4></summary>
            <p>The Great Unfluff — dourness and perpetual complaint — whose avatar is <strong>Emberclaw</strong>, the Orange Cat of Perpetual Judgment. We counter with humor, kindness, and the occasional feather boa.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Can anyone join?</h4></summary>
            <p>Yes. No exams, no purity tests, just an open heart and a willingness to look a tiny bit ridiculous for the sake of joy.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>What about tithes?</h4></summary>
            <p>Offerings of yarn, cookies, tales of kindness, and monetary support are welcome (for gatherings, glitter, and emergency bunny feed). Please, no cursed objects or jars labeled “Do Not Open.”</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Do you have clergy?</h4></summary>
            <p>Yes, with titles delightfully self‑assigned: High Priestess, Revered Hopper, Keeper of the Cookie Jar, Archbishop of Pillow Forts. Some clergy are cats. We do not discriminate.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Is there a Holy Book?</h4></summary>
            <p><em>The Velvet Testament</em> — still being compiled from napkins, margin notes, and late‑night group chats. It collects wisdom, rituals, and recipes in one very cozy tome.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Are you a cult?</h4></summary>
            <p>Only if joy, mutual kindness, and responsible glitter usage constitute a cult. Initiation costs one consensual hug. We are terrible at fleece‑ing people (except literally).</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>What happens when we die?</h4></summary>
            <p>We believe souls re‑embody as humans, animals, or (on very good days) perfectly baked loaves that make people inexplicably happy. Ultimate enlightenment: becoming a Luminous Bunny of the Astral Meadow.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>Do you have holidays?</h4></summary>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Fluffmas</strong> — Dec 26; the party after the party.</li>
              <li><strong>The Great Hoppening</strong> — Spring Equinox; eggs and questionable puns.</li>
              <li><strong>Glitterfall</strong> — first Monday after the first frost.</li>
              <li><strong>Random Fluff Day</strong> — declared spontaneously at Lyria’s whim.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>What’s the official greeting?</h4></summary>
            <p>“Halle‑hop!” (response: “Halle‑hop, Halle‑hop!”). Bowing is optional, encouraged if your ears are comically large.</p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary><h4>How do I start practicing?</h4></summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Perform one small kindness today (tell us about it if you like).</li>
              <li>Share a warm beverage with someone who needs it.</li>
              <li>Build a tiny pillow fort and read for ten minutes.</li>
              <li>Schedule a Monday Gathering. Wear bunny ears. Invite neighbors.</li>
            </ul>
